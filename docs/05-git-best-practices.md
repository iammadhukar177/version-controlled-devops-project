# ✅ Git Best Practices for DevOps Projects

Following Git best practices ensures a maintainable and collaborative codebase.

---

## 🧱 Commit Guidelines

- Commit often but meaningfully
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Example: `feat: add authentication flow`

---

## 🌿 Branching

- Use `main`, `dev`, and `feature/*` structure
- Avoid working directly on `main`
- Delete feature branches after merging

---

## 🔁 Pull Requests

- Use PRs for all merges
- Require code review before merge
- Merge using squash or rebase

---

## 🏷️ Tagging

- Use tags for marking release points
- Follow semantic versioning (e.g., v1.0.0)

---

## 🧼 Clean Codebase

- Use `.gitignore` to avoid committing unnecessary files
- Avoid committing secrets or sensitive files
- Keep commit history clean and linear
